# Project Description

ASIATL (ASI Alignment Tier List) is an open-source project dedicated to creating and maintaining a high-quality, community-curated Tier List of resources in the critical field of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alignment and AI Safety.  We aim to help researchers, policymakers, students, and concerned citizens navigate the complex landscape of AI Safety knowledge by identifying and ranking the most valuable resources.
 

**Our Mission:**
  Showcase Optimal Asi Alignment Resource Allocation.
  We aim to answer the question: "I want to help align Asi with a good outcome for humanity, where are my resources best put to use?"



## Roadmap

ASIATL is under active development and evolving in phases.  Our current roadmap includes:

*   **Phase 1: Core Functionality & Proof of Concept:**  (Initial website launch, basic Tier List display, initial LLM integration for proposal generation.)
*   **Phase 2: Enhanced LLM Integration & Tier List Refinement:** (Improving LLM proposal quality, refining ranking algorithms, enhanced data storage).
*   **Phase 3: Scaling and Community Growth:** (Expanding data, adding more LLMs, developing advanced data analysis tools, focused community building).
*   **Phase 4: Automation & Dynamic Updates:** (Automating core processes, continuous Tier List refinement, dynamic data updates).
*   **Phase 5: Endless Refinement & Upkeep:** (Long-term maintenance, ongoing adaptation, and community-driven evolution of ASIATL).
