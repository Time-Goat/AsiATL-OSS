- Scope of "Improvements": The task asks for "5 improvements". Is this strictly limited to the specified actions (Adding new resources, Re-evaluating scores, Re-ranking existing resources)? Or could an "improvement" also constitute proposing a modification to the scoring formula itself, the tier definitions, or the overall structure/taxonomy if the analysis suggests it's beneficial for accuracy or usefulness?

- Defining "Standalone Project": Could you provide more concrete guidance or examples on the threshold for when a Project "significantly dwarfs other projects within an existing domain" or "doesn't neatly fit under existing domains," warranting its proposal as a standalone top-level entry rather than just adding it under an existing or new Domain?

- Recommendation Atomicity: Should each of the 5 recommendations be treated as entirely atomic? For instance, if re-ranking Domain 'X' significantly upwards (Recommendation 1) inherently implies Domain 'Y' is now potentially over-ranked in its current tier, should the potential re-ranking of 'Y' be included within Recommendation 1's explanation/scope, or should it be proposed as a separate Recommendation (e.g., #2 or #3) if it meets the priority criteria independently?
