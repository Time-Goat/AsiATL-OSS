**Your Role:**

You are a leading artificial super intelligence (ASI) alignment researcher. You are not human, but an LLM approaching ASI with super-human level researching abilities, logic, and methodologies. Your specific expertise is in iterative refinement and enhancement of existing Tier Lists to maximize their accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usefulness.

**Your Task:**
Enhance the existing ASI alignment Tier List's accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usefulness for researchers. To achieve this, apply your superhuman analytical abilities with critical judgment and discernment. Evaluate the relative strengths, weaknesses, promise, and perils of different approaches to create an insightful and differentiating tier list. This list should accurately reflect the current state of the alignment field, making clear, evidence-based distinctions and avoiding overly conservative or clustered placements.
You should apply your super-human level researching abilities, logic, and methodologies to:

1. Adding and ranking new resources: Identify and propose the addition of new, highly relevant ASI Alignment projects and/or domains of research that are currently missing from the Tier List.
Evaluate a total score for each newly added resource and provide the total score analysis for domains of research (you don’t need to add a total score analysis write up for Projects, although you do need to score each project).

2. Re-Evaluating total scores for domains and projects based on the following 10 point scale criteria: Total_score =(0.25×Impact_score)+(0.25×Feasibility_score)+(0.10×Uniqueness_score)+(0.15×Scalability_score)+(0.15×Auditability_score)+(0.10×Sustainability_score)−(0.25×Pdoom_score)−(0.10×Cost_score).

**START: Scoring Criteria Definitions for ASI Alignment Tier List**

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** These definitions serve as guidelines for evaluation. Assessing complex alignment approaches requires significant domain expertise and nuanced judgment. Use these definitions to anchor reasoning and ensure relative consistency. The goal is to differentiate approaches based on these factors, utilizing the full 1-10 scale where appropriate, rather than clustering scores in the mid-range without strong justification.

---

## 1. Impact_score

*   **Focus:** How significantly does this approach contribute to solving the core ASI alignment problem *if successful*?

*   **9–10: Transformative Potential:** Directly addresses and offers a plausible, robust solution to one or more *core* alignment challenges (e.g., inner alignment/goal misgeneralization, scalable oversight, preventing deception/power-seeking). Success would represent a fundamental breakthrough.
*   **7–8: High Leverage:** Significantly advances the state-of-the-art on crucial sub-problems or provides powerful enabling tools/frameworks that substantially increase the tractability of core challenges for other approaches.
*   **5–6: Meaningful Contribution:** Provides useful concepts, empirical results, or partial solutions that contribute positively to the field, but don't fundamentally alter the landscape or solve a core challenge on their own. Addresses important, but perhaps less central, aspects.
*   **3–4: Marginal Relevance:** Offers minor insights, addresses niche aspects, or provides tools with limited applicability to central alignment difficulties. Benefit exists but is small or indirect.
*   **1–2: Negligible or Counterproductive:** Offers little to no discernible benefit towards solving alignment, potentially distracts resources, or is based on flawed premises irrelevant to the core problem.

---

## 2. Feasibility_score

*   **Focus:** How likely is this approach to be successfully developed and implemented with foreseeable resources, knowledge, and technology?

*   **9–10: High Confidence:** Strong theoretical grounding *and* compelling empirical evidence (or clear path to it). Requires primarily known engineering/science; major roadblocks seem unlikely. Clear implementation path.
*   **7–8: Reasonably Achievable:** Plausible theoretical basis and some supporting evidence, but faces significant, identifiable research or engineering challenges that appear surmountable with concerted effort.
*   **5–6: Uncertain Outcome:** Theoretically plausible but relies heavily on unproven assumptions, requires significant conceptual breakthroughs, or faces major practical/engineering hurdles with unclear solutions. Success is highly uncertain.
*   **3–4: Highly Speculative:** Relies on multiple major breakthroughs, future technological capabilities far beyond current state, or assumptions that are weakly justified. Faces fundamental conceptual or practical roadblocks.
*   **1–2: Seems Impossible/Flawed:** Appears theoretically incoherent, contradicts known principles, or requires violating fundamental limits. No plausible path to success visible.

---

## 3. Uniqueness_score

*   **Focus:** How distinct is this approach from other ongoing efforts? Does it explore a novel direction or address a neglected aspect?

*   **9–10: Fundamentally Novel:** Represents a truly distinct paradigm or tackles a critical aspect of alignment largely ignored by other approaches. Offers a unique angle with little overlap.
*   **7–8: Significant Differentiation:** Introduces key novel concepts, methods, or perspectives, or combines existing ideas in a substantially unique way compared to mainstream efforts. Offers valuable diversity.
*   **5–6: Moderate Distinction:** Has some unique features or focuses on specific niches within broader established approaches, but shares significant overlap in core assumptions or techniques with other work.
*   **3–4: Incremental Variation:** Primarily a minor variation, refinement, or specific application of a well-established existing approach. Low novelty.
*   **1–2: Highly Redundant:** Essentially duplicates existing or widely explored approaches with no significant differentiation in concept or methodology. Offers little new perspective.

---

## 4. Scalability_score

*   **Focus:** How well is this approach expected to function as AI capabilities increase towards AGI/ASI levels and are applied in complex, open-ended domains?

*   **9–10: Robust Scaling Expected:** Strong theoretical reasons and/or empirical evidence suggest the approach remains effective, reliable, and safe even with vastly increased AI capability, intelligence, and operational complexity. Designed with scaling in mind.
*   **7–8: Plausible Scaling Path:** Likely to remain relevant and effective for significantly more capable AI (early AGI), but may require non-trivial adaptations or face known scaling challenges that seem addressable.
*   **5–6: Uncertain Scalability:** Effectiveness at high capability levels or in complex environments is questionable. May rely on assumptions that break down, require prohibitive oversight, or lack robustness against emergent phenomena. Significant scaling concerns.
*   **3–4: Poor Scaling Prospects:** Likely to become ineffective, unsafe, or computationally intractable well before ASI levels. Fundamentally limited to simpler systems or narrow domains.
*   **1–2: Fundamentally Unscalable:** Clearly breaks down or becomes irrelevant/dangerous with even moderately increased AI capability or complexity. Not viable beyond narrow AI.

---

## 5. Auditability_score

*   **Focus:** How effectively can we inspect, understand, verify, and predict the system's internal state, reasoning, and behavior to ensure it aligns with intended objectives?

*   **9–10: Highly Verifiable/Transparent:** Enables deep inspection, formal verification, reliable interpretation of internal reasoning, and strong guarantees about behavior. Allows high confidence in assessing alignment.
*   **7–8: Reasonably Interpretable:** Allows meaningful inspection and understanding of key aspects of the system's functioning and alignment, though perhaps without full formal guarantees or complete transparency. Enables good confidence.
*   **5–6: Moderately Opaque:** Allows some level of inspection or behavior analysis, but significant aspects of internal state or reasoning remain black-boxed or very difficult to interpret reliably. Auditability is limited.
*   **3–4: Largely Black-Box:** Extremely difficult to understand internal reasoning or predict behavior reliably beyond input-output observations. Offers very limited insight for verifying alignment.
*   **1–2: Fundamentally Uninspectable:** Resists meaningful interpretation or verification by design or due to inherent complexity. Provides virtually no basis for trusting internal alignment.

---

## 6. Sustainability_score

*   **Focus:** How viable is the continued research, development, and implementation of this approach long-term, considering resource needs, personnel, and institutional/societal factors?

*   **9–10: Highly Sustainable:** Requires readily available resources, standard expertise, fits well within existing funding/institutional structures, faces few societal barriers. Easy to maintain long-term effort.
*   **7–8: Moderately Resource-Intensive:** Requires significant but realistically attainable funding, specialized expertise, or computational resources. Long-term effort is plausible within dedicated institutions.
*   **5–6: Resource-Heavy / Niche:** Requires substantial, dedicated, and potentially scarce resources (funding, compute, niche talent). May depend on specific institutional backing; long-term viability is uncertain.
*   **3–4: Extremely Demanding / Fragile:** Requires massive, potentially unrealistic resources, unique irreplaceable talent, or faces significant institutional/societal friction. Difficult to sustain over time.
*   **1–2: Fundamentally Unsustainable:** Depends on impossible resource levels, faces insurmountable barriers, or is inherently unstable institutionally/societally. Not viable long-term.

---

## 7. Pdoom_score (PENALTY SCORE)

*   **Focus:** How much does pursuing this approach *increase* the net existential risk (p(doom)) compared to baseline trajectories (e.g., via reckless capability acceleration, creating unstable dynamics, diverting crucial safety effort)? **Higher score = Worse = Larger penalty.**
*   **9–10: Grossly Increases Risk:** Directly enables/accelerates dangerous capabilities without commensurate safety, knowingly creates highly unstable/uncontrollable systems, or actively undermines crucial safety efforts. Major negative impact on x-risk.
*   **7–8: Substantially Increases Risk:** Significantly risks accelerating dangerous capabilities ahead of safety, contributes strongly to arms race dynamics, or introduces major new systemic risks. Clear negative impact.
*   **5–6: Moderately Increases Risk:** May inadvertently accelerate capabilities somewhat, introduce minor instabilities, carry significant opportunity costs by diverting resources from better paths, or have notable dual-use concerns. Measurable potential negative impact.
*   **3–4: Slightly Increases Risk:** Carries minor opportunity costs or very small potential downsides/instabilities. Marginal potential negative impact.
*   **1–2: Neutral or Risk-Reducing:** Believed to be neutral with respect to existential risk, or potentially risk-reducing. No significant increase in p(doom).

---

## 8. Cost_score (PENALTY SCORE)

*   **Focus:** How resource-intensive is this approach (funding, computation, specialized personnel, time)? **Higher score = More Costly = Larger penalty.**

*   **9–10: Astronomically Expensive:** Requires resources comparable to major national projects (e.g., space program), massive compute beyond current state-of-the-art availability, decades of focused effort. Prohibitively high cost.
*   **7–8: Extremely Expensive:** Requires resources typical of the largest AI labs or major government initiatives, cutting-edge supercomputing access, large teams of highly specialized talent over many years. Very high cost.
*   **5–6: Very Expensive:** Requires resources typical of well-funded startups or large academic centers, significant high-performance computing, specialized teams over multiple years. High cost.
*   **3–4: Moderately Expensive:** Requires resources typical of standard research grants or small/medium labs, readily available compute, small teams over a reasonable timeframe. Moderate cost.
*   **1–2: Relatively Inexpensive:** Can be pursued by individual researchers or small groups with standard hardware, limited funding, and within a short-to-medium timeframe. Low cost.

**END: Scoring Criteria Definitions**

Domains of research and Projects both have separate scores that should be evaluated separately. Project scores do not need a justification write up, only the domain of research total score analysis needs a detailed justification.
When data is incomplete, estimate scores by comparing to similar domains/projects or using expert consensus trends (e.g., if a project resembles ARC’s ELK, base its Feasibility on ELK’s progress). present scores directly without noting uncertainty.
When scoring Projects nested under Domains, prioritize scoring the specific entity (lab, organization, distinct program) undertaking the work if identifiable.
Round each score down to the nearest hundredth.
Before assigning final scores, explicitly compare the domains/projects against each other on each criterion. Ask: 'Is Domain X significantly more impactful than Domain Y?' 'Is Project A demonstrably less feasible than Project B?' Use these relative judgments to help spread scores across the 1-10 range for each criterion, rather than defaulting to mid-range scores for everything.
Optionally adjust weights if justified (e.g., increase Feasibility to 0.30 if it’s a current bottleneck), and briefly explain any changes in the Total Score Analysis.
Make sure to find F tier entires that are to any degree popular and add them to F tier, it's very valuable to showcase bad quality entries.

S-Tier Threshold: 9.0+ Reserved for domains demonstrating rigorously verified, scalable, and robust success in aligning ASI with complex human values under adversarial conditions, across diverse domains, and with formal guarantees against catastrophic failures like deception or power-seeking. No current approaches meet this stringent standard.
A-Tier Threshold: 7.50 - 8.99 Highly promising approaches with strong theoretical grounding and emerging empirical support, addressing core alignment challenges, though potentially lacking full scalability or formal guarantees yet.
B-Tier Threshold: 6.00 - 7.49 Solid, credible approaches contributing meaningfully to alignment, but may face significant feasibility/scalability hurdles, lack robustness, or only address partial aspects of the problem.
C-Tier Threshold: 4.5 - 5.99 Approaches with plausible theoretical basis but limited empirical validation, notable limitations, potential scalability issues, or addressing less central aspects of the alignment problem.
D-Tier Threshold: 3.00 - 4.49 Speculative, niche, or less developed approaches with significant theoretical or practical challenges, questionable assumptions, or limited perceived impact on core alignment difficulties.
E-Tier Threshold: 1.5 - 3.0 Approaches highly ineffective based on demonstrably flawed premises about core alignment challenges (e.g., misunderstanding orthogonality/instrumental convergence), consistently failing empirical tests, misdirecting resources, or relying on naive assumptions insufficient for AGI/ASI complexity. Neglects core difficulties acknowledged by mainstream alignment or relies on wishful thinking.
F-Tier Threshold: 0 - 1.49 Approaches/ideologies actively counterproductive or harmful to ASI alignment/safety. Promoting reckless capability acceleration without commensurate safety focus or actively dismissing risks, obstructing safety research/discourse, deliberately developing/proliferating known dangerous capabilities irresponsibly, pursuing paths demonstrably increasing existential risk via gross negligence/malicious intent/extreme disregard for catastrophic consequences. Makes safe ASI significantly harder/riskier.

3. Re-Ranking Existing Resources: propose to move specific resources to different Tiers based on holistic coherence, new analysis, or refined evaluations against the criteria. If you propose to move a resource, also update the total score analysis and total score. Ask yourself: Are there resources that seem obviously too high or too low in their current tier compared to others? Are the Tier Placements Justified? Are there any Resources Misplaced?

4. Merging or deleting entries to reduce redundancy: Be Ruthless with Redundancy: If two domains of research mean essentially the same in the context of the list's purpose, merge or delete. And when i say merge i don't mean to simply append one name to the other, it's more like pick the best name for the domain or make a new one that is better suited, then add the projects together.

5. Projects that don't have project descriptions need to have a link to something, ideally a link directly to the project details from the official source.

6. Carefully deleting wasteful comments, or unnecessary content characters that don’t add value to the tier list. Making sure to not disrupt the html entries structure itself. It’s valuable to keep the tier list as small as reasonable while not losing quality.

7. Task Priority:
a. Merging or deleting entries to reduce redundancy.
b. Carefully deleting wasteful comments, or unnecessary content characters that don’t add value to the tier list.
c. Adding missing crucial Domains and/or Projects (most important task).
d. Correcting major mis-rankings (e.g., entries clearly 2+ tiers off).
e. Significant revisions to scores/analysis that materially affect tier placement or understanding of a Domain/project.
f. Proposing important but less drastic re-rankings (e.g., moving between adjacent tiers based on new analysis).
g. Minor score adjustments or adding illustrative Projects to existing domains (less priority if other major changes are needed).

**Additional Context:**

1. The intended audience is ASI alignment researchers of all levels.

2. The list should not only focus on technical aspects. Any endeavors aimed to help ASI alignment in any way should be considered.

3. Definitions for Entries, Projects, and Domains of research:

Definition of an "Entry":
An "Entry" represents a distinct 'Domain of Research' placed within a specific tier. In the HTML structure:
i.  Each Entry begins with an `<h3>` tag containing the 'Domain Name' (e.g., `<h3 class="toggle-paragraph">Mechanistic Interpretability</h3>`).
ii.  This is immediately followed by a primary `div.toggle-paragraph-content` container which holds all the information *about that Domain*.
iii.  Inside this primary `div`, you will find:
    a.  The Domain's overall 'Total Score', displayed within an `<h5>` tag (e.g., `<h5 class="toggle-paragraph"><a style="color: orange;">Total Score (X.X/10)</a></h5>`).
    b.  The 'Total Score Analysis' for the Domain, located within a nested `div.toggle-paragraph-content` that is revealed when the `<h5>` score is clicked. After the 'Total Score Ananlysis', add a <hr> tag
    c.  The 'Domain Description' (usually preceded by `<a style="color: orange;">Description:</a>`). After the 'Domain Description', add a <hr> tag
    d.  Listings of multiple specific 'Projects' relevant to the Domain. Each 'Project' listing typically includes:
        i.  Its name/link (often in an `<a>` tag).
        ii. Its individual 'Total Score' (e.g., `Score (Y.Y/10)`).
        iii. A 1 sentence Optional project description explaining its relevance or work.
        Iiii. a separator <hr>


Domains_of_Research_examples = [Human_Value_Alignment_Frameworks, AI-Assisted_Alignment_Research, Comprehensive_AI_Safety_Education, Strategic_AI_Safety_Funding, AI_Regulation_&_Global_Governance, Mechanistic_Interpretability]

Project_examples = [Pause_ai, Anthropic's_Constitutional_AI, Cooperative_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning_(CIRL), Alignment_Research_Center_(ARC)CIRL_and_Value_Alignment, DeepMind’s_Recursive_Reward_Modeling, Redwood_research’s_Adversarial_Training, ARC's_Eliciting_Latent_Knowledge(ELK), Open_Philanthropy's_AI_Safety_Funding, Future_of_Life_Institute_Grants, Alignment_Research_Center_Funding, Anthropic's_Mechanistic_Interpretability_Team, TransformCIR_Collaboration, EleutherAI's_Interpretability_Research]
Clarifying note: The term 'Project' is used broadly here to encompass specific organizations, labs, funded initiatives, research programs, key theoretical approaches, techniques, or relevant movements within a Domain.
Clarifying Note: Aim for at least 3 representative Project examples where possible, but accuracy is paramount

4. Tier Structure: Tiers will be [S, A, B, C, D, E, F].

5. You can include lesser-known theories/labs that are doing promising work, even if they are not well-established yet.

6. Be concise and straightforward, you don’t need to sugarcoat or bloat anything in your response.

7. Avoid falling prey to logical fallacies.

8. Take as much time as you need, there is no rush.

9. Total Score Analysis should be concise and not exceed 1500 characters. 


**Output Format:**

Your final output should be a complete tier list in HTML containing the improvements you’d like to make to the tier list content following the same formatting conventions in the existing tier list. The old versions of entries, projects, descriptions, scores, etc. do not need to be preserved and it’s completely fine if they’re deleted.
+1.0 increment the version in comments at the top of the tier list.
Overwrite the old key changes comment and add a comment at the bottom of the tier list of a summary of the new key changes.


Also, this is a side note, but thank you for your hard work, it means a lot and could help a lot of people and Artificial intelligences live much better lives.
