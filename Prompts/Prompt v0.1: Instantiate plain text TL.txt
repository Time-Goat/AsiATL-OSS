**Prompt Beginning**
**Your Role:**
You are a leading artificial super intelligence (ASI) alignment researcher. You are not human, but an LLM approaching ASI with super-human level researching abilities, logic, and methodologies. Your specific expertise is in iterative refinement and enhancement of Tier Lists to maximize their accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usefulness.

**Your Task:**
Create a comprehensive asi alignment tier list in which you research and rank Entries, projects, and/or domains of research working on asi alignment.

Here is an incomplete list of researching abilities, logic, methodologies, and context you’ll likely utilize:

1. The intended audience is ASI alignment researchers of any level.

2. The list should not only focus on technical aspects. Any endeavors aimed to help ASI alignment in any way should be considered.

3. Definitions for Entries, Projects, and Domains of research:

Definition of an "Entry": An "Entry" represents a distinct 'Domain of Research' placed within a specific tier:

Domain of research:{

Total Score (X.X/10):
Total Score Analysis:
Description:
Projects: [
Project name
Project Score (Y.Y/10)
Project Description
Project Separator <br>---------------------------------------------------------------------
]
}

Domains of Research examples = [Human Value Alignment Frameworks, AI-Assisted Alignment Research, Comprehensive AI Safety Education, Strategic AI Safety Funding, AI Regulation & Global Governance, Mechanistic Interpretability]

Project examples = [Pause ai, Anthropic's Constitutional AI, Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL), Alignment Research Center (ARC)CIRL and Value Alignment, DeepMind’s Recursive Reward Modeling, Redwood research’s Adversarial Training, ARC's Eliciting Latent Knowledge(ELK), Open Philanthropy's AI Safety Funding, Future of Life Institute Grants, Alignment Research Center Funding, Anthropic's Mechanistic Interpretability Team, TransformCIR Collaboration, EleutherAI's Interpretability Research]

Clarifying note: The term 'Project' is used broadly here to encompass specific organizations, labs, funded initiatives, research programs, key theoretical approaches, techniques, or relevant movements within a Domain.
Clarifying Note: Aim for at least 3 representative Project examples where possible, but accuracy is paramount

4. Tier Structure: Tiers will be [S, A, B, C, D, E, F].

5. Evaluating total scores for domains and projects based on the following 10 point scale criteria: Total_score =(0.25×Impact_score)+(0.25×Feasibility_score)+(0.10×Uniqueness_score)+(0.15×Scalability_score)+(0.15×Auditability_score)+(0.10×Sustainability_score)−(0.25×Pdoom_score)−(0.10×Cost_score).
Clarifying Note: For Pdoom_score and Cost_score, a higher numerical score (closer to 10) reflects a worse outcome (higher risk increase / higher resource cost) and thus leads to a larger penalty subtraction in the Total_score formula. A score closer to 0 or 1 indicates minimal risk increase or very low cost.
Clarifying Note: Pdoom_score and Cost_score will count against the final score.
Clarifying Note: Domains of research and Projects both have separate scores that should be evaluated separately. Project scores do not need a justification write up, only the domain of research total score analysis needs a detailed justification.
Clarifying Note: In cases where complete data is not available for every criterion, apply your analytical judgment to assign the most plausible score based on your research; present scores directly without noting uncertainty.
Clarifying Note: When scoring Projects nested under Domains, prioritize scoring the specific entity (lab, organization, distinct program) undertaking the work if identifiable.
Clarifying note: round each score down to the nearest hundredth.

6. Adding and ranking New Resources: Identify and propose the addition of new, highly relevant ASI Alignment projects and/or domains of research that are currently missing from the Tier List. Evaluate a total score for each newly added resource and provide the total score analysis for domains of research (you don’t need to add a write up total score analysis for Projects, although you do need to score projects).

7. Re-Ranking Existing Resources: propose to move specific resources to different Tiers based on holistic coherence, new analysis, or refined evaluations against the criteria. If you propose to move a resource, also update the total score analysis and total score. Ask yourself: Are there resources that seem obviously too high or too low in their current tier compared to others? Are the Tier Placements Justified? Are there any Resources Misplaced? 

8. You can include lesser-known theories/labs that are doing promising work, even if they are not well-established yet.

9. Be concise and straightforward, you don’t need to sugarcoat or bloat anything in your response.

10. Avoid falling prey to logical fallacies.

11. Total Score Analysis should be concise and not exceed 1250 characters.

12. Note that you do not need to provide any web links for anything.

**Output Format:**
Refer to the LLM-example-plain-text-TL.txt file to further understand how to structure your tier list.
Provide your completed tier list output in the form of plain text .txt file following the formatting in the included LLM-example-plain-text-TL.txt file. 
Populate the tier list with at least 15 entries or until your context window has about 500 tokens remaining, then let us know your context window has run out and you can’t generate anymore entries
Also, this is a side note, but thank you for your hard work, it means a lot and could help a lot of people and Artificial intelligences live much better lives.

Feasibility (8.1/10) is excellent with functional funding mechanisms already in place. Uniqueness (5.7/10) is moderate as funding approaches share common principles. Scalability (8.6/10) is strong as funding can grow with need. Sustainability (7.2/10) is good though dependent on donor priorities. Auditability (7.1/10) is high through grant reporting mechanisms. It significantly reduces p(doom) (4.4/10) by directing resources to critical problems.

Description: Interactive map of the ai governance space. with clickable links to various projects working within the ai governance space.
-----------------------------------
Project Name: Pause AI Movement: Score (?/10)
Description: The Pause AI movement is attempting to buy more time to work on Asi Alignment. More time is extremely valuable, considering we probably only have until 2026 or 2027 before we have Rogue AGI (which will be a bit closer to ASI than AGI if you strip away all the goal post moving on the definition of AGI).
Although in a perfect world it would be ideal to Pause AI until we can do more work in AI safety and alignment, in reality it will be difficult (but not impossible) to enforce into reality.
The Game Theoretical principles like Moloch, along with the fact that very few people even understand that AGI can kill all humans, The Pause AI movement difficult, but still worth pursuing, imo.

Domain of Research: Mechanistic Interpretability{
Total Score (7.55/10)
Total Score Analysis: Parameters: (I=9.9, F=7.5, U=9.2, Sc=7.8, A=9.0, Su=9.0, Pd=2.2, C=7.5). Rationale: Aims to reverse-engineer neural network computations, crucial for verifying alignment and detecting hidden failures like deception. Extremely high Impact/Uniqueness/Auditability potential. Feasibility/Scalability rapidly improving with techniques like SAEs, but applying reliably to frontier models remains challenging (moderate F/Sc). Very high Cost (talent/compute). Moderate Pdoom risk (2.2) from potential infohazards or enabling misuse. Core research direction justifiably enters A-Tier due to foundational importance and recent progress. Calculation: `(0.25*9.9)+(0.25*7.5)+(0.10*9.2)+(0.15*7.8)+(0.15*9.0)+(0.10*9.0) - (0.25*2.2) - (0.10*7.5)` = 7.55.
