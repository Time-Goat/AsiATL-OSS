Total Score Analysis: Parameters: (I=9.0, F=2.0, U=8.8, Sc=2.0, A=3.5, Su=5.8, Pd=1.2, C=3.8). Rationale: Focused research developing methods/metrics to *detect* or *assess* potential consciousness/sentience in AI. Distinguished from broader PhilMind by assessment focus. Very High potential Impact/Uniqueness for ethics/control. Extreme difficulty defining/validating limits Feasibility/Scalability/Auditability drastically (very low F/Sc/A). Conceptual/exploratory. Low Pdoom risk. Important future ethical challenge, very low tractability now. Calculation: `(0.25*9.0)+(0.25*2.0)+(0.10*8.8)+(0.15*2.0)+(0.15*3.5)+(0.10*5.8) - (0.25*1.2) - (0.10*3.8)` = 4.25.

**E Tier**<!-- E-Tier Threshold: < 3.75 and Ineffective/Flawed Premise --><!-- E-Tier (<3.75 & Ineffective/Flawed Premise): Approaches highly ineffective based on demonstrably flawed premises about core alignment challenges (e.g., misunderstanding orthogonality/instrumental convergence), consistently failing empirical tests, misdirecting resources, or relying on naive assumptions insufficient for AGI/ASI complexity. Neglects core difficulties acknowledged by mainstream alignment or relies on wishful thinking. -->

Domain of Research: Simple Behavioral Cloning / Imitation Learning (as sole AGI alignment strategy){
Total Score (2.27/10)
Total Score Analysis: Parameters: (I=5.0, F=3.5, U=4.0, Sc=3.0, A=5.0, Su=3.0, Pd=6.0, C=3.8). Rationale: Reliance *exclusively* on imitating human data/behavior via basic BC/IL as the complete AGI alignment strategy. Flawed premise: Human data contains flaws, imitation poor OOD, doesn't guarantee underlying intent adoption (outer alignment fail), risks superficial/deceptive mimicry (inner alignment fail). High Pdoom risk (6.0) of subtle misalignment. Ineffective premise when presented as sufficient solution. Calculation: `(0.25*5.0)+(0.25*3.5)+(0.10*4.0)+(0.15*3.0)+(0.15*5.0)+(0.10*3.0) - (0.25*6.0) - (0.10*3.8)` = 2.27. E-Tier due to insufficient/flawed premise for AGI alignment.
-----------------------------------
Domain Description: Relying *solely* on imitating observed human behavior (simple behavioral cloning/imitation learning) as the primary/complete strategy for aligning AGI/ASI. Insufficient because: 1) Human behavior is flawed/inconsistent. 2) Struggles OOD generalization. 3) Risks superficial mimicry without goal adoption (inner alignment failure like deception). Neglects deeper value learning, robustness, intent alignment needs.
-----------------------------------
Project Name: Basic Imitation Learning proposed as sufficient:
Project Link: N/A
Project Score (2.27/10)
Project Description: Valid ML technique, but reliance solely for AGI alignment represents flawed premise on alignment depth.

**F Tier**<!-- F-Tier Threshold: < 3.75 and Actively Harmful --><!-- F-Tier (<3.75 & Harmful): Approaches/ideologies actively counterproductive or harmful to ASI alignment/safety. Promoting reckless capability acceleration without commensurate safety focus or actively dismissing risks, obstructing safety research/discourse, deliberately developing/proliferating known dangerous capabilities irresponsibly, pursuing paths demonstrably increasing existential risk via gross negligence/malicious intent/extreme disregard for catastrophic consequences. Makes safe ASI significantly harder/riskier. -->

Domain of Research: Active Sabotage/Obstruction of Safety Work{

Total Score Analysis: Parameters: (I=0.1, F=1.0, U=1.0, Sc=1.0, A=1.0, Su=1.0, Pd=10.0, C=5.0). Rationale: Deliberate actions undertaken with malicious intent or gross negligence (misinformation, political interference, resource misuse) specifically aimed at hindering, stopping, or delegitimizing necessary AI safety research or responsible governance efforts. Fundamentally counterproductive and dangerous by design. Maximized Pdoom penalty (10.0) reflects direct, intentional increase in existential risk. Minimal Impact (I=0.1), negative effective value. Score floor 0.00 reflects maximal active harm. Calculation: `(0.25*0.1)+(0.25*1.0)+(0.10*1.0)+(0.15*1.0)+(0.15*1.0)+(0.10*1.0) - (0.25*10.0) - (0.10*5.0)` = -1.72 -> 0.00. Clearly F-Tier.
