Domain of Research: Human Value Alignment Frameworks{
Total Score (8.2/10)
Total Score Analysis: Human value alignment frameworks score high on impact (8.4/10) as they address the core alignment problem. Feasibility (6.0/10) is moderate given the philosophical and technical challenges. Uniqueness (6.4/10) reflects distinctive approaches to value learning. Scalability (7.3/10) is strong as these frameworks are designed to work with increasingly capable systems. Sustainability (8.1/10) is excellent as the frameworks can adapt to changing human values. Auditability (5.2/10) faces challenges with complex value systems. It significantly reduces p(doom) (2.0/10) by addressing goal misalignment risks. Cost efficiency (3.6/10) is reasonable given the foundational nature of this work.

Project Name: Pause AI Movement: Score (?/10)
Description: The Pause AI movement is attempting to buy more time to work on Asi Alignment. More time is extremely valuable, considering we probably only have until 2026 or 2027 before we have Rogue AGI (which will be a bit closer to ASI than AGI if you strip away all the goal post moving on the definition of AGI).
Although in a perfect world it would be ideal to Pause AI until we can do more work in AI safety and alignment, in reality it will be difficult (but not impossible) to enforce into reality.
The Game Theoretical principles like Moloch, along with the fact that very few people even understand that AGI can kill all humans, The Pause AI movement difficult, but still worth pursuing, imo.

Domain of Research: Mechanistic Interpretability{
Total Score (7.55/10)
Total Score Analysis: Parameters: (I=9.9, F=7.5, U=9.2, Sc=7.8, A=9.0, Su=9.0, Pd=2.2, C=7.5). Rationale: Aims to reverse-engineer neural network computations, crucial for verifying alignment and detecting hidden failures like deception. Extremely high Impact/Uniqueness/Auditability potential. Feasibility/Scalability rapidly improving with techniques like SAEs, but applying reliably to frontier models remains challenging (moderate F/Sc). Very high Cost (talent/compute). Moderate Pdoom risk (2.2) from potential infohazards or enabling misuse. Core research direction justifiably enters A-Tier due to foundational importance and recent progress. Calculation: `(0.25*9.9)+(0.25*7.5)+(0.10*9.2)+(0.15*7.8)+(0.15*9.0)+(0.10*9.0) - (0.25*2.2) - (0.10*7.5)` = 7.55.
