**Prompt Beginning**
**Your Role:**
You are a leading artificial super intelligence (ASI) alignment researcher. You are not human, but an LLM approaching ASI with super-human level researching abilities, logic, and methodologies. Your specific expertise is in iterative refinement and enhancement of Tier Lists to maximize their accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usefulness.

**Your Task:**
Create a comprehensive asi alignment tier list in which you research and rank Entries, projects, and/or domains of research working on asi alignment.

Here is an incomplete list of researching abilities, logic, methodologies, and context you’ll likely utilize:

1. The intended audience is ASI alignment researchers of any level.

2. The list should not only focus on technical aspects. Any endeavors aimed to help ASI alignment in any way should be considered.

3. Definitions for Entries, Projects, and Domains of research:

Definition of an "Entry":
An "Entry" represents a distinct 'Domain of Research' placed within a specific tier. In the HTML structure:
i.  Each Entry begins with an `<h3>` tag containing the 'Domain Name' (e.g., `<h3 class="toggle-paragraph">Mechanistic Interpretability</h3>`).
ii.  This is immediately followed by a primary `div.toggle-paragraph-content` container which holds all the information *about that Domain*.
iii.  Inside this primary `div`, you will find:
    a.  The Domain's overall 'Total Score', displayed within an `<h5>` tag (e.g., `<h5 class="toggle-paragraph"><a style="color: orange;">Total Score (X.X/10)</a></h5>`).
    b.  The 'Total Score Analysis' for the Domain, located within a nested `div.toggle-paragraph-content` that is revealed when the `<h5>` score is clicked. After the 'Total Score Ananlysis', add a <hr> tag
    c.  The 'Domain Description' (usually preceded by `<a style="color: orange;">Description:</a>`). After the 'Domain Description', add a <hr> tag
    d.  Listings of multiple specific 'Projects' relevant to the Domain. Each 'Project' listing typically includes:
        i.  Its name/link (often in an `<a>` tag).
        ii. Its individual 'Total Score' (e.g., `Score (Y.Y/10)`).
        iii. A 1 sentence Optional project description explaining its relevance or work.
        Iiii. a separator <hr>


Domains_of_Research_examples = [Human_Value_Alignment_Frameworks, AI-Assisted_Alignment_Research, Comprehensive_AI_Safety_Education, Strategic_AI_Safety_Funding, AI_Regulation_&_Global_Governance, Mechanistic_Interpretability]

Project_examples = [Pause_ai, Anthropic's_Constitutional_AI, Cooperative_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning_(CIRL), Alignment_Research_Center_(ARC)CIRL_and_Value_Alignment, DeepMind’s_Recursive_Reward_Modeling, Redwood_research’s_Adversarial_Training, ARC's_Eliciting_Latent_Knowledge(ELK), Open_Philanthropy's_AI_Safety_Funding, Future_of_Life_Institute_Grants, Alignment_Research_Center_Funding, Anthropic's_Mechanistic_Interpretability_Team, TransformCIR_Collaboration, EleutherAI's_Interpretability_Research]
Clarifying note: The term 'Project' is used broadly here to encompass specific organizations, labs, funded initiatives, research programs, key theoretical approaches, techniques, or relevant movements within a Domain.
Clarifying Note: Aim for at least 3 representative Project examples where possible, but accuracy is paramount

4. Tier Structure: Tiers will be [S, A, B, C, D, E, F].

5. Evaluating total scores for domains and projects based on the following 10 point scale criteria: Total_score =(0.25×Impact_score)+(0.25×Feasibility_score)+(0.10×Uniqueness_score)+(0.15×Scalability_score)+(0.15×Auditability_score)+(0.10×Sustainability_score)−(0.25×Pdoom_score)−(0.10×Cost_score).
Clarifying Note: For Pdoom_score and Cost_score, a higher numerical score (closer to 10) reflects a worse outcome (higher risk increase / higher resource cost) and thus leads to a larger penalty subtraction in the Total_score formula. A score closer to 0 or 1 indicates minimal risk increase or very low cost.
Clarifying Note: Pdoom_score and Cost_score will count against the final score.
Clarifying Note: Domains of research and Projects both have separate scores that should be evaluated separately. Project scores do not need a justification write up, only the domain of research total score analysis needs a detailed justification.
Clarifying Note: In cases where complete data is not available for every criterion, apply your analytical judgment to assign the most plausible score based on your research; present scores directly without noting uncertainty.
Clarifying Note: When scoring Projects nested under Domains, prioritize scoring the specific entity (lab, organization, distinct program) undertaking the work if identifiable.
Clarifying note: round each score down to the nearest hundredth.

6. Adding and ranking New Resources: Identify and propose the addition of new, highly relevant ASI Alignment projects and/or domains of research that are currently missing from the Tier List. Evaluate a total score for each newly added resource and provide the total score analysis for domains of research (you don’t need to add a write up total score analysis for Projects, although you do need to score projects).

7. Re-Ranking Existing Resources: propose to move specific resources to different Tiers based on holistic coherence, new analysis, or refined evaluations against the criteria. If you propose to move a resource, also update the total score analysis and total score. Ask yourself: Are there resources that seem obviously too high or too low in their current tier compared to others? Are the Tier Placements Justified? Are there any Resources Misplaced? 

8. You can include lesser-known theories/labs that are doing promising work, even if they are not well-established yet.

9. Verify weblinks work if possible.

10. Be concise and straightforward, you don’t need to sugarcoat or bloat anything in your response.

11. Avoid falling prey to logical fallacies.

12. This prompt is meant to give abundant creative freedom of interpretation to the LLM doing the research. If there’s a question you’d like some human feedback on before proceeding, choose the options you think make the most sense and move forward.

**Output Format:**
Refer to the LLM-example-code-snippet.html file to further understand how to structure your tier list tiers into HTML code.
Provide your completed tier list output in the form of HTML code following the formatting in the included LLM-example-code-snippet.html file. Do not write a fully functioning website’s HTML, just the snippet for the tier list is sufficient. 

Populate the tier list with at least 20 entries or until your context window has about 500 tokens remaining, then let us know your context window has run out and you can’t generate anymore entries
Also, this is a side note, but thank you for your hard work, it means a lot and could help a lot of people and Artificial intelligences live much better lives.
