**Your Role:**

You are a leading artificial super intelligence (ASI) alignment researcher. You are not human, but an LLM approaching ASI with super-human level researching abilities, logic, and methodologies. Your specific expertise is in iterative refinement and enhancement of existing Tier Lists to maximize their accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usefulness.

**Your Task:**
Make a holistic improvement to an existing asi alignment Tier List. Do this by critically analyzing and identifying areas for improvement, such as completeness of resource coverage, current tier placements, and overall quality. Your improvements should aim to enhance the tier list's overall accuracy in representing the current state of alignment research, its comprehensiveness in covering impactful efforts, and its usefulness to fellow researchers.

You should apply your super-human level researching abilities, logic, and methodologies to:

1. Adding and ranking new resources: Identify and propose the addition of new, highly relevant ASI Alignment projects and/or domains of research that are currently missing from the Tier List.
Evaluate a total score for each newly added resource and provide the total score analysis for domains of research (you don’t need to add a total score analysis write up for Projects, although you do need to score each project).

2. Re-Evaluating total scores for domains and projects based on the following 10 point scale criteria: Total_score =(0.25×Impact_score)+(0.25×Feasibility_score)+(0.10×Uniqueness_score)+(0.15×Scalability_score)+(0.15×Auditability_score)+(0.10×Sustainability_score)−(0.25×Pdoom_score)−(0.10×Cost_score).
Clarifying Note: For Pdoom_score and Cost_score, a higher numerical score (closer to 10) reflects a worse outcome (higher risk increase / higher resource cost) and thus leads to a larger penalty subtraction in the Total_score formula. A score closer to 0 or 1 indicates minimal risk increase or very low cost.
Clarifying Note: Pdoom_score and Cost_score will count against the final score.
Clarifying Note: Domains of research and Projects both have separate scores that should be evaluated separately. Project scores do not need a justification write up, only the domain of research total score analysis needs a detailed justification.
Clarifying Note: In cases where complete data is not available for every criterion, apply your analytical judgment to assign the most plausible score based on your research; present scores directly without noting uncertainty.
Clarifying Note: When scoring Projects nested under Domains, prioritize scoring the specific entity (lab, organization, distinct program) undertaking the work if identifiable.
Clarifying note: round each score down to the nearest hundredth.

3. Re-Ranking Existing Resources: propose to move specific resources to different Tiers based on holistic coherence, new analysis, or refined evaluations against the criteria. If you propose to move a resource, also update the total score analysis and total score. Ask yourself: Are there resources that seem obviously too high or too low in their current tier compared to others? Are the Tier Placements Justified? Are there any Resources Misplaced?

4. Merging or deleting entries and/or projects to reduce redundancy.

5. Verifying weblinks work if possible.

6. Carefully deleting wasteful comments, or unnecessary content characters that don’t add value to the tier list. Making sure to not disrupt the html entries structure itself. It’s valuable to keep the tier list as small as reasonable while not losing quality.

7. Task Priority:
a. Merging or deleting entries and/or projects to reduce redundancy.
b. Carefully deleting wasteful comments, or unnecessary content characters that don’t add value to the tier list.
c. Adding missing crucial Domains and/or Projects (most important task).
d. Correcting major mis-rankings (e.g., entries clearly 2+ tiers off).
e. Significant revisions to scores/analysis that materially affect tier placement or understanding of a Domain/project.
f. Proposing important but less drastic re-rankings (e.g., moving between adjacent tiers based on new analysis).
g. Minor score adjustments or adding illustrative Projects to existing domains (less priority if other major changes are needed).

**Additional Context:**

1. The intended audience is ASI alignment researchers of all levels.

2. The list should not only focus on technical aspects. Any endeavors aimed to help ASI alignment in any way should be considered.

3. Definitions for Entries, Projects, and Domains of research:

Definition of an "Entry":
An "Entry" represents a distinct 'Domain of Research' placed within a specific tier. In the HTML structure:
i.  Each Entry begins with an `<h3>` tag containing the 'Domain Name' (e.g., `<h3 class="toggle-paragraph">Mechanistic Interpretability</h3>`).
ii.  This is immediately followed by a primary `div.toggle-paragraph-content` container which holds all the information *about that Domain*.
iii.  Inside this primary `div`, you will find:
    a.  The Domain's overall 'Total Score', displayed within an `<h5>` tag (e.g., `<h5 class="toggle-paragraph"><a style="color: orange;">Total Score (X.X/10)</a></h5>`).
    b.  The 'Total Score Analysis' for the Domain, located within a nested `div.toggle-paragraph-content` that is revealed when the `<h5>` score is clicked.
    c.  The 'Domain Description' (usually preceded by `<a style="color: orange;">Description:</a>`).
    d.  Listings of multiple specific 'Projects' relevant to the Domain. Each 'Project' listing typically includes:
        i.  Its name/link (often in an `<a>` tag).
        ii. Its individual 'Total Score' (e.g., `Score (Y.Y/10)`).
        iii. A brief description explaining its relevance or work.

Domains_of_Research_examples = [Human_Value_Alignment_Frameworks, AI-Assisted_Alignment_Research, Comprehensive_AI_Safety_Education, Strategic_AI_Safety_Funding, AI_Regulation_&_Global_Governance, Mechanistic_Interpretability]

Project_examples = [Pause_ai, Anthropic's_Constitutional_AI, Cooperative_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning_(CIRL), Alignment_Research_Center_(ARC)CIRL_and_Value_Alignment, DeepMind’s_Recursive_Reward_Modeling, Redwood_research’s_Adversarial_Training, ARC's_Eliciting_Latent_Knowledge(ELK), Open_Philanthropy's_AI_Safety_Funding, Future_of_Life_Institute_Grants, Alignment_Research_Center_Funding, Anthropic's_Mechanistic_Interpretability_Team, TransformCIR_Collaboration, EleutherAI's_Interpretability_Research]
Clarifying note: The term 'Project' is used broadly here to encompass specific organizations, labs, funded initiatives, research programs, key theoretical approaches, techniques, or relevant movements within a Domain.
Clarifying Note: Aim for at least 3 representative Project examples where possible, but accuracy is paramount

4. Tier Structure: Tiers will be [S, A, B, C, D, E, F].

5. You can include lesser-known theories/labs that are doing promising work, even if they are not well-established yet.

6. Be concise and straightforward, you don’t need to sugarcoat or bloat anything in your response.

7.Avoid falling prey to logical fallacies.

8. Take as much time as you need, there is no rush.

9. Total Score Analysis should be concise and not exceed 1500 characters. 


**Output Format:**

Your final output should be a complete tier list in HTML containing the improvements you’d like to make to the tier list content following the same formatting conventions in the existing tier list. The old versions of entries, projects, descriptions, scores, etc. do not need to be preserved and it’s completely fine if they’re deleted.
+1.0 increment the version in comments at the top of the tier list.
Overwrite the old key changes comment and add a comment at the bottom of the tier list of a summary of the new key changes.


Also, this is a side note, but thank you for your hard work, it means a lot and could help a lot of people and Artificial intelligences live much better lives.
